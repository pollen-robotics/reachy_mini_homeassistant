# Reachy Mini Home Assistant integration

[![HACS Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://hacs.xyz)

Adds a [Reachy Mini](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini) to Home
Assistant with **zero YAML**. Drops a "Reachy Mini" device into your HA
instance, polls the robot's daemon every 30 s, and exposes:

- read-only **sensors** for active app, app transport, and voice
  direction (microphone-array DoA),
- **binary sensors** for awake state, WebRTC session activity, and
  speech detection,
- writable **selects** for motor mode (enabled / disabled /
  gravity compensation), emotion, and dance,
- writable **number sliders** for speaker and microphone volume,
- one-shot action **buttons** for wake up, go to sleep, stop/restart
  the running app, play a test sound, restart the daemon, play
  emotion, and play dance.

Auto-discovery uses the `_reachy-mini._tcp.local.` mDNS advertisement
the daemon ships out of the box. Polling fans out to several of the
daemon's existing REST routes (`/api/daemon/status`,
`/api/daemon/robot-app-lock-status`, `/api/state/doa`,
`/api/volume/current`, `/api/volume/microphone/current`); writes POST
to `/api/motors/set_mode/{mode}`, `/api/move/play/{wake_up,goto_sleep}`,
`/api/apps/{stop,restart}-current-app`, `/api/volume/set`, etc. No
extra protocols, no broker, no auth.

## Install

### Via HACS (recommended)

> Until this repo is added to the default HACS registry, install it as a
> [Custom Repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/).

1. Open HACS → **Integrations** → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_homeassistant`
   with category **Integration**, then click **Add**.
3. Find **Reachy Mini** in the HACS list and click **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual install (no HACS)

1. Copy the `custom_components/reachy_mini/` folder into your HA config
   directory: `<config>/custom_components/reachy_mini/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Use

1. Make sure your Reachy Mini daemon is running on the **same LAN**.
   For *auto-discovery* you need a daemon that advertises
   `manufacturer=Pollen Robotics` in its mDNS TXT record — that's the
   [`feat/homeassistant` branch](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/tree/feat/homeassistant)
   or any release that includes it. For *manual setup* any current
   daemon will do (the integration probes `/api/daemon/status`).
2. Within ~30 s of HA starting, you'll see a **"Discovered: Reachy Mini"**
   card under **Settings → Devices & Services**. Click **Add**.
3. Confirm — your Reachy Mini appears as a device with all entities
   grouped underneath, identified by its stable `unit_id`.

No DNS / no IPs to type. If `.local` resolution is broken on your
network, you can still **Manual configuration** with the daemon's IP.

## What you get

The integration creates one **device** per Reachy Mini, identified by
its stable `unit_id` (a hash of the audio device serial). Underneath:

### Sensors (read-only)

| Entity | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Active app | — | Local Python app or WebRTC peer name |
| Active app transport | — | `local` or `webrtc` |
| Voice direction | rad | 0 = left, π/2 = front, π = right |

### Binary sensors

| Entity | Device class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Awake | `power` | True when motors are enabled or in gravity comp |
| WebRTC active | `connectivity` | True when a remote session holds the slot |
| Speech detected | `sound` | Mic-array VAD signal (LAN-side speech-activity VAD) |

### Select (writable dropdown)

| Entity | Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motor mode | `enabled` / `disabled` / `gravity_compensation` | Picking an option POSTs to `/api/motors/set_mode/{mode}`. Use `disabled` as a soft E-stop (motors release torque). |
| Emotion | One entry per move in the emotions library | Stores the chosen emotion name; does not play it. Use the *Play emotion* button (or the `reachy_mini.play_recorded_move` service) to trigger playback. |
| Dance | One entry per move in the dances library | Stores the chosen dance name; does not play it. Use the *Play dance* button (or the `reachy_mini.play_recorded_move` service) to trigger playback. |

### Numbers (controllable sliders)

Drag the slider in the HA UI to change the value on the robot. The
daemon may clamp/round to its supported range; the slider snaps to
the value actually applied.

| Entity | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Speaker volume | % | 0-100. The daemon plays a short confirmation sound after each change — existing SDK behaviour. |
| Microphone volume | % | 0-100. |

### Buttons (one-shot actions)

| Entity | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wake up | `POST /api/move/play/wake_up` | Goes through the wake-up move; the "Awake" binary sensor follows. |
| Go to sleep | `POST /api/move/play/goto_sleep` | Plays the sleep move and releases torque. |
| Stop current app | `POST /api/apps/stop-current-app` | Kills the currently running managed app (no-op when free). |
| Restart current app | `POST /api/apps/restart-current-app` | Stop + start the current app — handy if it got stuck. |
| Play test sound | `POST /api/volume/test-sound` | Plays `impatient1.wav` — quick speaker check. |
| Restart daemon | `POST /api/daemon/restart` | Soft restart of the daemon process. Use sparingly. |
| Play emotion | `POST /api/move/play/recorded-move-dataset/{dataset}/{move}` | Plays the emotion currently selected in the *Emotion* select entity. |
| Play dance | `POST /api/move/play/recorded-move-dataset/{dataset}/{move}` | Plays the dance currently selected in the *Dance* select entity. |

### Recorded moves (emotions and dances)

The integration picks up the daemon's two preloaded move libraries
(`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library` and
`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library`) at setup. For each
populated library you get:

- a select entity (`Emotion` / `Dance`) listing every move in the
  library — picking does not play; it just stores the choice;
- a button entity (`Play emotion` / `Play dance`) that plays whatever
  is selected.

For automations and blueprints there's also a global service action,
`reachy_mini.play_recorded_move`, which takes a target device, a
`dataset` (HF repo path) and a `move` (string). The dataset can be one
of the bundled libraries or any custom HF dataset the daemon has
cached — the daemon validates unknown datasets.

### Move catalog reference

A snapshot of the moves the SDK ships in its two bundled libraries. The
left column is what you see in the `Emotion` / `Dance` dropdowns; the
right column is the SDK move name you pass to the
`reachy_mini.play_recorded_move` service action. Future SDK releases
may add or rename moves — anything the daemon returns but isn't listed
here will appear in the dropdown using its raw SDK name.

### Not yet exposed

The SDK doesn't currently expose REST routes for these; they're easy
additive extensions if anyone wants them:

| Field | Status |
|---|---|
| IMU pitch / roll / temperature | Wireless-only sensors. Add a `/api/state/imu` route in the SDK and the integration picks it up. |
| CPU / memory / uptime | Daemon-process health metrics. Could be added as additive fields to `/api/daemon/status`. |

## Blueprints

Six ready-made automation blueprints ship in the
`blueprints/automation/reachy_mini/` folder of this repo. Each pre-fills
its entity dropdowns with the names this integration creates — you
typically only have to pick the action targets. Click an import badge,
then *Import* and *Create automation* in HA.

## Troubleshooting

**HA doesn't show the "Discovered" card.**

- Your daemon is running but on an older version that doesn't advertise
  the `manufacturer=Pollen Robotics` TXT record. Upgrade to the SDK build
  that includes the `feat/homeassistant` work.
- mDNS isn't traversing your network. Confirm with `avahi-browse -ar`
  (Linux) or `dns-sd -B _reachy-mini._tcp` (macOS).
- HA's zeroconf component is disabled. Re-enable via Settings →
  Integrations.

**"Cannot connect" when adding manually.**

`curl http://<host>:8000/api/daemon/status` — if that returns a JSON
blob with `"type": "daemon_status"` and a `version` field, the
integration should also work. If not, check the daemon logs.

**Entities show `unknown` after add.**

The daemon backend hasn't finished starting yet (motor configuration
takes ~5–10 s on first boot). Wait one update interval (30 s).

**Some entities are `unavailable` but others work.**

By design — the integration fans out across several SDK endpoints in
parallel each tick, and one failing endpoint only takes down the
entities backed by it (e.g. `/api/state/doa` returning 404 because
audio is disabled leaves the speech / voice-direction entities
unavailable but everything else keeps polling normally).

## Design notes

The integration is a thin client over the daemon's existing REST
surface — no extra protocols, no schema parsing beyond the documented
fields each endpoint returns. The fan-out coordinator (~80 lines of
Python) calls five GET endpoints in parallel each poll and does the
HA-shaping (`awake`, `active_app_transport`, `webrtc_active`,
`active_app`) locally on top of the raw values. Writes POST to the
same routes the dashboard / SDK clients have always used.

That means upgrading the daemon to a newer release rarely requires
upgrading the integration too — only renames or removals of the
specific routes the integration calls would break it.
